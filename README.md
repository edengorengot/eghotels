### Welcome to the EG Hotels website code files :-)

This is a site for our hotels, you can create hotels, manage your admin team and have a club membership for the clients.

They can enter the website and mark their favorites among your hotels.

In the future, we will see admin staff making reservations for clients for each hotel.


A user who is logged in can get to his "My Account" page, and if he is an admin, he will be able to create hotels and promote users to admins.
the clients will not see the "Admin Dashboard".

Each user could reset his password if he forgot it.

Of course, you can browse the site without registering and logging in.

##### The first admin account needs to be created with the help of direct change in the database.
##### First, create a user by sighing up, then go to MongoDB (I recommend via MongoDB Compass) and change the admin attribute from 0 -> 3 for full control.

#### Happy reading and browsing :-)
